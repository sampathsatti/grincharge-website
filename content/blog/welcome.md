Introducing GrinCharge that builds solar-powered electric charging stations along with eco-cafes. Our company is motivated by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By generating power from renewable energy sources like solar, we aim to maximize the green impact of electric vehicles (EVs) and reduce CO2 emissions. Our charging stations consist of EV supply equipment, an array of solar panels, an inverter to convert solar power from DC to AC, an energy storage system, charge controllers, and a secure network for the wireless transmission of data to help users make real-time decisions1.

Our cafes are designed to provide a comfortable and relaxing environment for EV owners while they wait for their vehicles to charge. We believe that our cafes will help reduce range anxiety and promote the adoption of electric mobility. Our charging stations can be installed in the parking lots of shopping centers, offices, restaurants, gyms, rest stops along highways, parks, among others, making it easy for the public to charge their vehicles and reduce range anxiety.

If we scaled to 1,000 installations, the world would change in many ways. We'd be removing 3 million tonnes of C02 that would have been emitted due to charging electric vehicles from a polluting grid.
