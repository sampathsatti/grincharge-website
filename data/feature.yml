title: 1. Polluting, burdened grid.
description: According to the Central Electricity Authority, the average CO2 emissions intensity of hourly electricity supply in India was 800 gCO2 per kWh. Electricity from Solar generates 8 times less emissions. Moreover, the electrical grid is unable to keep up with the high demand, especially from fast DC charging stations.
description2: Not everyone can install rooftop solar.

Title2nd: 2. Electric Vehicles ❤️ Indian Roads and traffic
description2nd: Electric Vehicles are tailor made for Indian roads. There are no tail pipe emissions, regenerative braking is extremely efficient in start-stop traffic, and the lower speed limits on roads increase overall efficiency. The charging infrastructure also needs to keep up with the growing adoption of EVs for customer satisfaction.

title3rd: 3. Solar powered microgrids operating as virtual power plants
description3rd: Currently the grid is a monolithic entity, where electricity is simply a commodity with no knowledge of its provenance. Outages can happen at the grid level. Solar powered microgrids in contrast build local community resilience and electricity is generated in a green manner. The large grid itself can be strengthed, where the microgrid feeds power back into the grid during times of high demand.

title4th: 4. Bringing it all together
description4th: Think of a gas station for your EV. You utilize green electricity generated from the solar panels at the station. While your vehicle recharges, so can you! The gas station will have a cozy cafe which will be a destination unto itself.
